# Medimops Price Scan (mmps)

### :warning: The code is not fully usable yet, since I'm refactoring the structure of the database.

This is a program to fetch data from the reselling platform [medimops®](https://www.medimops.de/) such as book prices and sales.

#### Usage
Enter "user" information (e.g. name & email) in url-files in db/urls and make "scans" regularly. You will be able to keep track of price developments in the database and plot it in respect to time.

- No [medimops®](https://www.medimops.de/) account needed
- No official API involved
